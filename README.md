# Slim fractals in basins of a magnetic pendulum

## Description

A magnetic pendulum that is attracted to three magnets lying in a plane is an example of a dissipative autonomous system whose basins of attraction exhibit fractal-like behavior.  What gives rise to such systems?  What are the statistical laws that govern the structures of the basins?
