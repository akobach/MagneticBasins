# Project Title

Slim fractals in basins of a magnetic pendulum

## Description

A magnetic pendulum that is attracted to three magnets lying in a plane is an example of a dissipative autonomous system whose basins of attraction exhibit fractal-like behavior.  What gives rise to such systems?  What are the statistical laws that govern the structures of the basins?  

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Required julia libraries:
* DifferentialEquations
* Revise
* LaTeXStrings
* Colors
* ThreadsX
* ProgressMeter
* BenchmarkTools
* DoubleFloats

### Installing

* Just download the repo, install the needed python packages, and run locally.

### Executing program

There are three running modes:
* training
* testing
* playing

In order to play or test, you must first train the agent by play it pitted against itself.

The file main.py has examples on how to run all three modes:

```
>> python main.py
```
